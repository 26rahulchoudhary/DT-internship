Counselor: Hi Maya, welcome to our career counseling session. How are you feeling today?

Maya: Hi Mr. Thompson, I’m doing okay. Honestly, I’ve been thinking a lot about my future and it’s a bit overwhelming.

Counselor: That’s completely understandable. What’s been on your mind specifically?

Maya: I’m in my final year of a business management degree. I really enjoy the marketing side of things, but I’m not sure if I should go into digital marketing or something more strategic like brand development.

Counselor: Both are great paths. What parts of marketing do you find most exciting?

Maya: I love understanding what makes people connect with a brand. Creating messaging and visual strategies is really fun for me. I worked on a campaign simulation project recently, and it was one of my favorite assignments.

Counselor: That’s a great strength. Have you done any internships or part-time work related to marketing?

Maya: Yes, I interned with a fashion startup over the summer. I helped run their Instagram page and created some content plans. It was creative, but I felt like I wasn’t doing much decision-making.

Counselor: That’s a useful observation. So you're leaning toward roles with more strategic responsibility?

Maya: Exactly. I want to be involved in the planning stages and contribute ideas that shape the brand direction.

Counselor: Excellent. What goals have you set for yourself over the next few months?

Maya: I want to develop a small portfolio with some mock branding projects, maybe even help a local business with their branding. I’m also thinking about applying to master’s programs in marketing strategy.

Counselor: That’s a solid plan. Let’s map out a timeline. How about finishing two branding case studies by the end of this month, researching grad schools in October, and preparing your applications in November?

Maya: That sounds totally manageable. Having deadlines helps me stay on track.

Counselor: I’m glad to hear that. Also, I’d encourage you to attend virtual marketing events or meetups—connecting with professionals can open up new opportunities.

Maya: Good idea! I’ve always wanted to attend a marketing summit but wasn’t sure where to start.

Counselor: I can share a few resources after our session. And how about we schedule a check-in next month to see how your portfolio is coming along?

Maya: I’d love that. Thank you so much for your support!

Counselor: You’re welcome, Maya. Keep up the great work, and I’ll talk to you soon.
