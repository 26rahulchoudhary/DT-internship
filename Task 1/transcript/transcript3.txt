Counselor: Good afternoon, Leo. Welcome to your career guidance session. How have you been?

Leo: Hi Ms. Raymond, I’ve been doing well. Lately, I’ve been trying to figure out where I want to go with my art career after college.

Counselor: That’s a great place to start. Can you tell me more about what you're studying and what interests you most?

Leo: I’m in my final year of a Bachelor’s in Fine Arts. I specialize in illustration and digital painting. I love creating concept art, especially for stories and games. But I’m also curious about roles in creative direction.

Counselor: That’s exciting. What do you enjoy most about concept art and creative direction?

Leo: I like the storytelling aspect—bringing characters and environments to life. But I also enjoy brainstorming with others and guiding visual ideas. I think that’s why creative direction sounds appealing.

Counselor: Have you had any hands-on experience in the field?

Leo: I’ve worked on a few collaborative projects with classmates—one was a short animated film where I led the visual development. I also did a remote internship for a small game studio where I contributed some character designs.

Counselor: That sounds like fantastic experience. What did you take away from those projects?

Leo: I realized how much I enjoy leading the visual side of a project. But I also know I need to improve my organizational skills and learn more about working with teams in a professional setting.

Counselor: That’s good self-awareness. So, what are your short-term goals?

Leo: I want to build a strong portfolio that showcases both my art and my ability to lead visual design. I’m also thinking of applying to a few artist residencies or creative internships to get more professional exposure.

Counselor: Those are excellent goals. Let’s create a timeline. How about completing your portfolio by mid-October, researching residency opportunities throughout September, and starting applications by November?

Leo: That works! I think I can commit to that.

Counselor: Great. I’d also recommend joining online art communities or attending portfolio review events. They’re great for networking and feedback.

Leo: I’ve been meaning to do that. I’m just a bit nervous about putting my work out there.

Counselor: That’s normal, but the more you share, the more confident you'll become. Let’s also schedule a follow-up in a month to see how things are progressing.

Leo: I’d appreciate that. Thanks, Ms. Raymond. This conversation has really helped clarify my next steps.

Counselor: I’m glad to hear that, Leo. You’ve got a strong direction—just keep taking it one step at a time. I’ll see you next month!
