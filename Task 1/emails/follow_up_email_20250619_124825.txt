Hi Maya,

It was great speaking with you yesterday! Thanks for taking the time to meet and explore your options after graduation. I know it can feel overwhelming thinking about the future, but I was really impressed with your insights and your enthusiasm for brand development and marketing strategy. Just to recap, we talked about how you enjoyed the creative side of your past internship but are now looking to leverage your strengths in more strategic planning roles. To help you get there, we discussed building a portfolio with mock branding projects to showcase your skills, researching and applying to marketing strategy master's programs, and expanding your network by attending local marketing events.

To keep things moving forward, I'd recommend tackling these action items over the next two weeks: (1) Spend some time brainstorming ideas for 2-3 mock branding projects and outlining the key elements you'd like to include. Aim to have a rough outline ready by next Friday. (2) Begin researching potential marketing strategy master's programs that align with your interests and career goals. Make a list of at least 3 programs by the end of the following week. Remember, I'm here to support you throughout this process. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need any resources. I've scheduled a follow-up meeting for [Date and Time - To be Added] to discuss your progress and answer any questions you may have. Keep up the great work, Maya - I'm confident you'll find a path that's a great fit for you!

Best,

Mr. Thompson
